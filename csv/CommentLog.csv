KS,2020-11-08 00:00:00,"Populate 2019 with measurements taken after 2020 calibration of SOC Reflectometer still checking to ensure all data is present -- could not find witness for one coating run"
KS,2020-11-09 00:00:00,Add Tabs for Witness Data and Optical Surface data
LG,2020-11-10 00:00:00,"Relabeled the witness sample and optical surface to Primary Witness Sample & Primary Surface Data. Modified the data for those tabs to match the 2020 and 2019 data format coming from the spectrometer.  Added Instrument Calibration Check and Secondary & Tertiary Witness Sample & Surface Data worksheets. Removed the Primary and Secondary worksheets datahas been resaved in new format in the added worksheets."
KS,2020-11-23 00:00:00,Begin data dump in Primary Witness page.
LG,2020-12-09 00:00:00,"Fixed column error for install & measured date flipped depending on whether it's a witness or optical surface measurement. Fixed some issue with formating on the numbers input in REV5. Also added columns so the column formating is same on all worksheets so the read in via matlab is way easier and don't need a custom read in primary vs secondary vs tertiary"
LG/EB,2020-12-18 00:00:00,Added MIRROR BARN worksheet for rate of decay tests in good environment
KS,2020-12-28 00:00:00,Changed date format to DD-MM-YYYY for Luke's script.  Format can be applied by going to Format Cells > Custom >  [$-en-US]dd-mm-yyyy;@  listed at the bottom.  Can type in mm/dd/yy format and it should update accordingly.
KS,2021-01-18 00:00:00,Removed working data files; created an Annual %R Log to contain all measurement data by year.
LG,2021-06-03 00:00:00,made sure worksheet format was the same across all sheets
LG,2021-06-08 00:00:00,"Fixed date errors creting read issue in matlab. Chnaged TM and SM mirrors references from A B C to numbers 1 2 3 to make reading easier in matlab"
LG,2021-12-29 00:00:00,"Update with date from 2021 %R_rev_2021-12-29  2020 %R_rev_2021-12-29  2019 %R_rev_2021-12-29"
