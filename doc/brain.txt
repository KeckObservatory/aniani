1) find the change in date

        delta_date = measured_date - install_date

2) get snow data? - I think this is turning a excel sheet into dates wheen it snowed

3) calculate spectral "S_measument" data for the primary mirror

    S_average = mean (1) / max (2) / min (3) / rms (4)
    for "S_spectral" data for PM, witness sample 'clean'

4) find difference between measured "S" and average "S" for each wavelength
   find the coating degredation value
   find standard data of the degredation

    S_delta = S_measured - S_average for each wavelength

    S_degrade = S_delta - S_average for each wavelength

    S_slope = mean (1) / max (2) / min (3) / rms (4) of S_degrade

5) FOR EACH TELESCOPE AND SEGMENT, find the lastest date for each segment position with degredation
   (was only doing this when there was new data added?)
   (I think he was comparing the date verses the segment data he already had based on what was on the telecop e)
   if the coating starting date equaled the save most current date = all values nan (3-8) in tel_current


    if Blue Refelctive values values are Nan, use average values??? (400-490 is blue light)

    if S_Spectral/S_measurement (6) ->>> S_measurment_400-540 T == (is not a number)

        S_telscope_segment_current = S_average_mean + (-1 * S_slope_rms * S_telescope_segment_current)

    else: S_telscope_segment_current = S_measurement + (-1 * S_slope_rms * S_telescope_segment_current)

6) plotting K1 then K2
   

    if tel_current(3)_date is NAN
        use segment install data plotting

    plot estimated reflectiviey values -> tel_current(5, 6, 7, 8)

    plot average reflectance

       mean ( tel_current for 5, 6, 7, 8 )(estimated reflectivity values)

    plot current date

    plot estmiate rate of decay R/year

        -1 * S_Slope_rms(4) * 365 for all wavelength
